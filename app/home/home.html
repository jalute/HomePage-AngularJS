    <h2>Why a homepage?</h2>
    <p>I had a personal website that I developed back in the early 1990s that predated social media sites (ie. Facebook and MySpace) and blogs!
    Creating a website gave anyone the ability (at the time) to express one's creativity, opinions, and feelings
    to the WORLD! I felt very enpowered that I had the ability to do this when a very small group of people
        were capable of creating a website.</p>
    <p>It was fun to create and it was written in 100% HTML.  I can't resurrect that website
        because all of the original digital art I created are stored on one of the (probably dead) hard drives in my closet.
        I had some fantastic digital painting software and all my art is gone...</p>
